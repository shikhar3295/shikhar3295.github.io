&lt;p&gt;This was a proof of concept project that I did as part of my coursework in Financial Information Systems. The goal was to finalize stocks, indexes and options for a real-life user. I used the following steps to do the analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looked at the stock market to identify a portfolio which would suit the requirements. Considered the following aspects when looking at the stocks:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversification &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correlation between stocks &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk associated with each stock &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Benefits (Dividends) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defined the KPIs for each stock and selected ones with best performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chose an index on similar attributes as described above. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decided to put options in place to minimize risk. Looked at the stocks which are most volatile and placed appropriate options after doing a cost benefit analysis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After having chosen the stocks, optimized the portfolio weighting for each stock and came up with number of stocks to purchase. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computed Maximum Expected Loss using value at risk and expected shortfall models and gave the green light as expected risk was lesser than the marker risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projected potential returns using CAPM Model and by running a monte carlo simulation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculated total returns based on the investment and presented findings in front of a group of over 100 people. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a proof of concept project where we looked at various factors impacting the feasibility of having an office in Botswana. We used the following steps to do our analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conducted survey of the country -- looked at the economic trends, conducted SWOT analysis, and evaluated locations for potential office sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looked at the telecom industry in Botswana and identified the key service providers who could provide us with connectivity in order to maintain business. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluated different types of connections being offered in Botswana and looked at how each connection was evolving with time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did thorough analysis on each telecom provider to come up with pros and cons for each provider. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalized the requirements of the new office -- including telecom and road connectivity. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyzed key challenges to going live with the new office -- Identified security as most vital challenge. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Came up with security measures to ensure that things go smoothly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presented the evaluation to the client and gave final recommendations for location, network and security!&lt;/li&gt;
