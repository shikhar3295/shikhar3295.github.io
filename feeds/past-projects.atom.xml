&lt;p&gt;This was a proof of concept project that we did in conjuntion with JN Bentley UK. We used the following steps to do our analysis:
1. Conducted survey of existing client operations 
2. Identified key areas for process improvements
3. Defined project scope and set up key milestones 
4. Created thorough data flow diagrams to visualize client processes at various levels of depth
5. Finalized all areas needing improvements 
6. Came up with a detailed design of the new system, including the database architecture
7. Evaluated multiple ERP Systems as replacements and analyzed the feasibility of each system
8. Gave a ranking to each solution based on key factors defined by client
9. Finalized a system for adoption and presented client an implementation plan to integrate system within their platform. &lt;/p&gt;
